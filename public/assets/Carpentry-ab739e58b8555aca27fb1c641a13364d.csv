Taking it apart so that you can easily put it together is the issue. Extra effort while dismantling the bed can mean saving time and having less frustration later when putting the bed back together.  ,Disassemble a bed. Tools needed to disassemble a bed. ,,,1,,"Floor Frame Beds1. Remove the mattress and box spring from the floor frame. Move them out of the room to free up the work space.2. Undo the bolts and nuts that hold the headboard and footboard to the frame using the appropriate tools. Ask your assistant to hold the headboard or footboard while you're undoing the hardware. Have him hold it so it remains vertical. Leaning can cause the bolts and nuts to bind, making it more difficult to remove them.<br><br>3. Loosen the wing-nuts holding the extension connecting arms of the frame together. Pull the frame apart. Fold down the extension connecting arms so they are flush with the main side rails of the frame. Some frames, though, are one solid piece and can't be broken down. Knock the frames apart with a rubber mallet if needed. <br><br>Raised Frame Beds<br>4. Remove the mattress, box frame and cross-bracing slats between the two side rails. Put them in a different room to clear the work space.5. Undo the hardware bolts and nuts that are holding one of the side rails to the headboard and footboard. If a bolt or nut spins while you're trying to undo them, you will need to hold the bolt head with one wrench while holding the nut with another and turn them opposite of each other.6. Ask the assistant to hold the footboard while you undo the hardware on that end of the side rail. Have him move the footboard out of the way and go hold the headboard up while you remove the nuts and bolts of the side rail. Let the free end of the rail rest on the floor to take the pressure off the nuts and bolts. Too much lean will cause the hardware to bind.Bunk beds7. Remove the safety rail from the upper bunk bed by loosening and extracting the nuts and bolts holding it to the side rail. Use the appropriate wrenches to do the job.8. Remove the mattresses, box springs and cross-bracing slats between the side rails of each bed. Remove all of these items from the room to free up the work space.9. Pull or push the bunk bed frames away from any surrounding walls so that you can work around them.10. Undo latches or hardware that hold the legs of the headboard and footboard of the upper bed frame to the headboard and footboard of the lower bed frame.11. Ask the assistant to stand at one end of the headboard while you stand at the other end of the headboard. Count to three and then lift the top bunk bed frame up off the lower bed frame and move it to an open area of the room. Use the rubber mallet to hit the undersides of the upper bed frame it they don't easily separate. Set it down in an open area of the room. Repeat the disassembly instructions for raised bed frames to take both bunk bed frames apart.<br> Source: eHow",,,,,Single Branded,Hyderabad,220,,,,,,,,,,,,,Double Regular,Hyderabad,275,,,,,,,,,,,,,Double Branded,Hyderabad,330,,,,,,,,,,,,,Bunk Regular,Hyderabad,385,,,,,,,,,,,,,Bunk Branded,Hyderabad,450,,,,,,,,,Repair a Bed,task,Bed,Type,,Hyderabad,0,Carpentry/Fix-bed.jpg,Fixing awould depends on the type of the problem you are facing.

Then you replace it in the existing jamb. Switching out the door in an old jamb is a great solution when you have a door that's badly warped or damaged, or when you want to upgrade all the doors in your home to improve quality or change style.",Fitting or replacing a house door.,,,1,4GnSucbFuWw,"Before you begin, measure the width and height of the old door (the thickness of all but the oldest interior passage doors is standardized at 1 _ inches). Bring these dimensions with you when you buy the new door ""blank""Üunlike a ""prehung"" door, it won't be surrounded by a jamb or drilled out for the lockset. Doors come in just a few heightsÜ80 inches is the standardÜbut a wide range of standard widths.<br><br>1: Remove the old door<br>Stand on the hinge side of the door and remove the pins from the hinges. Always start at the bottom hinge and work up so the door doesn't topple over onto you. If a pin won't come out by hand, gently tap it out with a hammer and screwdriver. Have a helper support the door as you begin to remove the top pin.<br><br>2: Mark the new door for trimming<br>Remove the lockset (doorknob) and hinges from the old door. If reusing the lockset, note how it goes together. Lay the new door across a pair of sawhorses and set the old door on top, aligning the top end and the lockset edge of the old door perfectly flush with the new door. Trace around the old door with a pencil to indicate where the new door must be trimmed down to size.<br><br>3: Cut the door down to size<br>Score the pencil marks on the new door with a sharp utility knife and straightedge to help prevent the wood from splintering when you cut it with a circular saw.Cut the door to the correct height using a straightedge guide and a circular saw. If you need to remove more than 1 inch, take half off the bottom of the door and half off the top. Trim the door to width in the same manner.<br><br>4: Lay out the hinge mortises<br>Lay the old door back on top of the new door, aligning them so that all four edges are flush. Line up a combination square with the old door's hinge mortises and transfer their locations to the new door. <br><br>5: Chisel out for the hinges<br>Lay a protective pad on the floor and stand the new door on edge, with the hinge layouts facing up. Next, chisel out for the hinges (these are called hinge mortises). Hold the chisel vertically and tap it with a hammer to outline the mortise. Then make a series of closely spaced cuts as deep as the thickness of the hinge. Next, hold the chisel at a low angle with its beveled face flat against the wood to prevent it from digging in too deeply when completing the mortise. Lightly tap the chisel with the hammer to chip away the waste wood a little bit at a time.<br><br>6: Screw on the hinge<br>Check the depth of the hinge mortises by test-fitting a hinge leaf; it should be flush with the door edge. If necessary, use the chisel to pare away a bit more wood. Set the hinge leaf into the mortise. Use a drill and centering bit to bore pilot holes through the screw holes. Screw the hinge to the door. Test-fit the door in the opening. Check that it closes without binding and that there's proper clearance (1/8 inch) between the door and frame. If not, plane the edges.<br><br>7: Drill for and assemble the lockset<br>Mark where the strike-plate hole meets the door edge. Position the template supplied with the lockset on this mark and mark for the doorknob and latch. If reusing the old lockset, take measurements from the old door. Drill the doorknob face bore with a 2 1/8-inch hole saw. Cut the latch's edge bore with a 7/8-inch spade bit. Paint or stain the door, as desired, and let dry. Insert the latch assembly into the edge bore and trace around it with a utility knife. Chisel out a shallow mortise inside this outline.  Screw the latch to the door, then install the doorknobs. <br><br>8: Hang the new door<br>Hold the door in the opening and interlace the hinge knuckles. Once all the hinges are aligned, have a helper insert the hinge pins. Test the door, making sure it swings smoothly and that the latch engages the strike plate on the doorjamb.
