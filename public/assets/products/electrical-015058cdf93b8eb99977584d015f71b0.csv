Fan Capacitor Replacement,task,Fan,,,Hyderabad,100,Electrical/Fan-Capacitor.jpg,"When one does fail to function properly, the problems can usually be traced to an accumulation of dirt in the motor's bearings or to a defective motor capacitor. With modern fans, the capacitor plays an integral role in controlling the motor speed. Replacing a defective capacitor is an easy repair that almost anyone can complete with relative ease.","Replace Fan capacitor, tools to replace fan capacitor for best prices.",,,1,,"1. Turn off the circuit breaker on the service panel supplying power to the ceiling fan. Ensure you have turned off the correct breaker by bringing the noncontact voltage tester near the fan's switch cover. Erect the stepladder beneath the ceiling fan.<br><br> 2. Disassemble the light kit on the ceiling fan. Remove the light bulbs and lampshades. Remove the screws that secure the light fixture to the fan's housing. There are usually three screws on the side of the housing. Unscrew the plastic wire nuts to disconnect the fixture wires. <br><br> 3. Find the motor capacitor. The motor capacitor is a black box with two to five wires coming out of it, depending on the make and model of the fan. The capacitor connects to the fan switch. The capacitor leads are color coded but the motor leads may not be. Tag the motor leads with colored tape before disconnecting the old capacitor, if necessary. Remove the old capacitor by unscrewing the wire nuts connecting its leads to the motor and switch leads.

Remove snap-on cover of bell or chime. Removal may be harder than you expect; there are several different types of covers, and you may have to try several procedures. Try lifting cover slightly upward and then pulling it out. If this doesn't work, pull it straight out without first lifting it up. Or look to see whether snap-on cover is held to bell or chime assembly with prongs; if so, depress prongs and pull cover to release it.

Once cover is removed, look for two, three, or more terminals and wires, depending on how many tones ring in your doorbell system. A standard bell or buzzer has two wires. Detach wires by loosening terminal screws, then connect them to 12-volt circuit tester, or attach them to terminal screws on substitute bell or chime. An inexpensive bell or buzzer or a 12-volt car lamp bulb in a socket with two wires can be used for testing purposes.
